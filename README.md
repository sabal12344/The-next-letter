#  **The Next Letter**

  
 		A game where you type the next letter after the computer enters a letter,  
 		not the next letter in the alphabet but the next letter according to the qwery order in your keyboard.
 
 	You are supposed to do that    
   	in the most accurate    
   	and  the fastest way possible to get the most positive evaluation.

   **Remember : Getting complimented by the evaluation has been made easier but it is still difficult nonetheless.**
